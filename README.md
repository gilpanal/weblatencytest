The following repository is a Proof Of Concept to measure the latency in modern web browsers by using a MLS signal (a type of noise). 
The app will play and record the MLS noise using the Web Audio API and will compute the cross correlation to estimate the delay. 
A graph is also displayed showing the resulting peak of the cross correlation and the wave form of audio data recorded.
